# Credit Onboarding Workflow Template

Use Abstra Workflows to build custom credit onboarding processes.

This is a functional template with the following steps:

- Onboarding form that collects personal info and the request for credit
- Credit engine with simple scoring rules
- Automatic review for requests that comply with the scoring rules
- Manual review for requests that don't comply with the scoring rules
- Approval email via Sendgrid for approved requests
- Internal notification via Slack for rejected requests

This template integrates with Slack and Sendgrid.
For those to work, you must add your own API Key to these services.
